## Education
### [Bachelor of Information Technology | Carleton University](http://www.bitdegree.ca/index.php?Program=NET)
#### 2016-Ongoing (Graduating 2021)
Carleton University's Bachelor of Information Technology is a 4 year program, hosted 50/50 at Carleton University and Algonquin College.

This allows for advanced theory courses to be offered through Carleton University, while maintaining access to Algonquin College's sophisticated networking labs.

Through this I have gained several hundred hours of hands-on experience with networking hardware including Aruba Wireless Access Points, and Cisco Routers/Switches.


#### Relevant Courses
* ```Course Name | Course Description | Grade Achieved```
* Intermediate Programming | Intermediate level C++ course; Polymorphism, inheretance, etc. | B
* Linux Networking | Basics of Linux as a server/router; DNS, DHCP, NTP, Apache, Docker, etc. | B
* Basics of Transmission Systems | Transmissions techniques employed for various media (wired/radio) | B
* Database Concepts and SQL | Database design using MySQL | A
* Real-Time Systems | Assembly/C fundamentals; Designing and implementing Arduino microsystems | A

* Desktop and Server Environments | Windows Server 2016; Powershell, DHCP, DNS, etc. | A-

## Work Experience
### [Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/home.html) | Network Administration; Software Development
#### May-August 2018; January-August 2019
Working within the federal government of Canada has provided me with uniquely varied work experience.

Given relative freedom to pursue projects which personally interest me, I have thrived and made extensive use of my networking knowledge as well as programming expertise gained through years of personal use and formal training.

Duties include network configuration and troubleshooting, VM management, software design, ethernet cabling, VPN configuration, etc.

## Projects
### [FXGames (Java FX Games)](https://github.com/amcpeake/FXGames) | February 2019 - Ongoing
FXGames is a small collection of simple games written in Java, using JavaFX for graphics.
Used as a more entertaining means of improving my Java/JavaFX knowledge.

Currently includes Pong

### [Python Development Environment (PyDE)](https://github.com/amcpeake/PyDE) | January 2019-Ongoing
PyDE began as an online Python IDE, but has evolved into an expansive multi-language IDE.
It currently consists of a single ~300 line script, and has facilitated my mastery of Bash.
This has been used for CodePoints, however I also plan to integrate it into my personal website as well as my discord bot, Tony Spark.

### [CodePoints](https://github.com/amcpeake/CodePoints) | January 2019-Ongoing
CodePoints is an add-on to PyDE which functions as a programming-based game. Users are given a series of challenges, and must write code to solve them. Though the application is currently limited in scope, it is an ongoing project, and expansion is to be expected.

### [Python File Browser (PyFib)](https://github.com/amcpeake/PyFib) | November 2018-Ongoing
My website is run off of a Raspberry Pi running at home, and while I was using it as a local network drive (NFS and Samba), I wanted to extend the utility of the network drive with the goal of never having to carry a USB drive with me again. The result is PyFib, which will eventually be implemented on my website and server as a web portal for personal cloud storage.

### [Personal Website](https://www.amcpeake.com) | July 2018-Ongoing
My personal website mostly serves as my testing grounds for various projects. There is much more going on in the background on hidden pages than is displayed from the main url. That said it serves as a view of some of my smaller hobby projects (i.e. meme generator)

### IPList | May 2018-August 2018
IPList, written while working for the Government of Canada, was a ~200 line bash script which served a purely utilitarian purpose. Understanding of the current network address space was lacking, (i.e. which ip addresses were used) and IPList was created to remedy this. Initially it only pinged each IP in a series of given subnets to determine if they were used or not. However, I realized that by creating a non-sudo account on each device I could gather further information, such as uptime, available storage, RAM, hostname, etc.

In the end, this became a fundamental piece of software for IT administrators in the environment, and remains in use.

### [Tony Spark (TSpark)](https://github.com/amcpeake/TSpark) | January 2018-Ongoing
Tony Spark is a hobby project, created by myself and [@ehrenjn](https://github.com/ehrenjn). It's only intended for use in our personal discord server, but serves as a catalogue of various interesting ideas implementing in python. This includes cloud storage, a bandcamp/soundcloud downloader, and an enhanced search function (Discord's built-in search function leaves something to be desired) to name a few. As this is a hobby project, the quality of code/documentation is sub-standard.
